What it can do
--------------
### Check your own stats:
* Rank and country rank
* Performance points
* Ranked and total score
* Your level and experience
* Your play count
* Your SS/S/A
* Your UID <-- mainly to fill the space, but just in case it can still be useful

### Compare two players on their:
* Rank
* Ranked and total scores
* Accuracy
* Playcount
* Performance points

It also displays the avatar of the user.

What it doesn't do (but might happen if asked, drop an issue if interested)
------------------------------------
* Retrieve your top plays

What it won't ever do
---------------------
* Compare more than two players (looks quite hard to implement the way i'm doing things)

If you want to build yourself...
--------------------------------
You'll need Visual Studio 2015 to open the solution
