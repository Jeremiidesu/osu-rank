# osu!rank 4.5.0

Small open-source utility to show your rank or compare two players without the need to open the website (osu! and Ripple)

Requires you to use your own osu! API key (if you want to use the osu! part), available [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/api). Just fill in whatever name and website, it's automated.

Our discord server is located right [here](https://discord.gg/Uydavrp). Come and say hi (or drop some feedback)! 

[osu!forums topic](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/478865)

ripple forums topic - as soon as ripple forums come (if they ever come)

### Notes to translators:

**Please translate on [OneSky](http://osbr5ar.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=91868) now please. It will be easier afterwards to add translations in.**

What it can do
--------------
### Check your own stats:
* Rank and country rank
* Performance points
* Ranked and total score
* Your level and experience
* Your playcount
* Your SS/S/A
* Your UID <-- mainly to fill the space, but just in case it can still be useful

### Compare two players on their:
* Rank
* Ranked and total scores
* Accuracy
* Playcount
* Performance points

It also displays the avatar of the user.

What it doesn't do (but might happen if asked, drop an issue if interested)
------------------------------------
* Retrieve your top plays

What it won't ever do
---------------------
* Compare more than two players (looks quite hard to implement the way I'm doing things)

If you want to build yourself...
--------------------------------
You'll need Visual Studio 2015 to open the solution
