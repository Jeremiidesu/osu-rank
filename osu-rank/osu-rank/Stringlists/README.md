## How to translate:
* Look first if your language is in the table below.
* If it is, you can update it if its line isn't bolded
* Just translate all the files with an higher version number than the current one, then open an issue with translated strings
* If it's not there, just translate all the files. 

### If you have a GitHub account, you can either...
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/Jeremiidesu/osu-rank/issues)
* Edit the file yourself and open a pull request

### If you don't have a GitHub account
* Fill up [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/YBbGcH07QCLvfBMw1) with the translations so I can add it into the program for the next update :)

## Translation support
A bolded line means the language is up to date.
