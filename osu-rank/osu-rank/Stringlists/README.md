## How to translate:
* Look first if your language is in the table below.
* If it is, you can update it if its line isn't bolded
* Just translate all the files with an higher version number than the current one, then open an issue with translated strings
* If it's not there, just translate all the files. 
* Open an issue with the translations so I can add it into the program for the next update :)

## Translation support
A bolded line means the language is up to date.
