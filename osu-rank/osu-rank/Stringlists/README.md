## How to translate:
* Look first if your language is in the table below.
* If it is, you can update it if its line isn't bolded
* Just translate all the files with an higher version number than the current one, then open an issue with translated strings
* If it's not there, just translate all the files. 

### If you have a GitHub account, you can either...
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/Jeremiidesu/osu-rank/issues)
* Edit the file yourself and open a pull request

### If you don't have a GitHub account
* Send a private message to either Jeremiidesu or Mark9870 on the osu! forums. 
* You also can post the translations on the forum post.
